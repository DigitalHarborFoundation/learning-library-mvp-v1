# Learning Library

A searchable database of curated resources, lessons, and other types of learning content. Built with the [Digital Harbor Foundation](https://www.digitalharbor.org/).

Check it out: [https://library.digitalharbor.org/](https://library.digitalharbor.org/)

## Inspiration

- Many folks have expressed the need for a resource database that pulls from _vetted_ resources with user-friendly searching
- We wanted a way to provide open, curated resources for learners that act as a starting point

## Features

- DHF staff are vetting resources across a variety of topics such as fabrication, design, and general tech literacy
- Frontend app pulls these curated resources from an [Airtable](https://airtable.com/) database
- Resource pages are shareable
- Ability to filter by pathway
- Playlists are curated lists of resources

## Coming Soon

- Multiple filters (OS, skill level)
- Shareable searches (sharing your filters with someone)
- Upvoting process - current ratings are based on curator ratings, but ultimately will have a process for users to upvote resources
- Community resource submission process

## Made With

- [Next.js (React)](https://nextjs.org/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [ChakraUI](https://chakra-ui.com/), [SWR](https://swr.now.sh/), and [Airtable](https://airtable.com/).
- Hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
